## How to Use the Application

### Starting the Application

```bash
php artisan serve
```

### Admin Panel Access

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/admin/dashboard`
2. Login with:
    - Email: `admin@example.com`
    - Password: `password`

### Public RSVP Form

- Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/rsvp`
- Enter your name to search for your invitation
- Follow the multi-step form to complete your RSVP

## Testing Commands

### Run All Tests

```bash
php test_rsvp_application.php
```

### Re-seed Test Data

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### Clear Cache

```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

## Test Scenarios for Manual Testing

### 1. New RSVP (Neighbors Group)

- Go to `/rsvp`
- Enter "Christopher Taylor" or "Linda Taylor"
- Complete the RSVP form
- Verify confirmation email (if mail is configured)

### 2. Update Existing RSVP

- Go to `/rsvp`
- Enter "John Smith" (Family group already has RSVP)
- The system should show that RSVP exists
- (Note: Current implementation doesn't allow updating through public form, only admin can modify)

### 3. Admin Functions

- Login as admin
- View dashboard statistics
- Create/edit groups
- Create/edit guests
- View RSVPs
- Export RSVPs to CSV

### 4. Edge Cases

- Try entering a name that doesn't exist
- Test form validation with invalid data
- Navigate between form steps
- Test with different attendance counts

## Known Limitations

1. **RSVP Updates**: The public form doesn't currently allow updating existing RSVPs (only admin can modify)
2. **Email Configuration**: Email sending requires proper mail configuration in `.env`
3. **Server Ports**: If port 8000 is in use, use a different port with `php artisan serve --port=8001`

## Security Considerations

1. Admin routes are protected by authentication
2. Input validation is implemented on all forms
3. SQL injection protection through Eloquent ORM
4. CSRF protection enabled
5. XSS protection through Laravel's built-in features

## Performance Considerations

1. Database queries are optimized with eager loading
2. Pagination implemented for large datasets
3. Caching can be implemented for frequently accessed data
4. Export functionality uses streaming for large datasets

## Future Enhancements

1. Allow guests to update their own RSVPs with a unique link
2. Add dietary restrictions or meal preferences
3. Implement plus-one functionality
4. Add guest photo upload
5. Create QR codes for easy RSVP access
6. Add SMS notifications alongside email
7. Implement analytics dashboard for RSVP trends

## Conclusion

The Wedding RSVP application has been thoroughly tested and is functioning correctly. All core features are working as expected, including guest management, RSVP submission, admin panel, and export functionality. The application is ready for production use with proper mail configuration.
